# How to Jailbreak Newest iPhones( iPhone 13 Supported) and iOS 15 Devices

Tired of waiting for the iOS 15 Jailbreak? Well today I have a method that allows you to manually Jailbreak your iPhone on iOS 15 or higher. Jailbreak iPhone iOS 15-15.6 with exploit apps! Download both from links when prompted then open flow_divert app click the button and then finally open ipc_kmsgs app and click the button. If your phone screen turns pink and you can see your apps burnt into the screen, then it is working. After your phone turns back on, search filza escaped iOS 15 and download it to your iDevice. Find the latest cydia deb file or any repo deb file you want to install. Share the Debian file to filza escaped and click on it in the app. Click Install or extract. Make sure that the file is in the directory you want it to be installed. For example, roblox mod menu Debian should be placed in the com.Roblox directory. Do not click Respring if you are doing this on iOS 15+. If on iOS 14 or lower, you can click the Respring button. If you are using iOS 15 or higher, you will want to repeat the kernel root exploit/jailbreak method that involved your phone turning pink and crashing. When you open the app or your phone turns on, your desired Debian should be installed. I tested all of this on my iPhone 13 Pro Max and I have to say that you need to be fast in filzaescaped or else your phone might crash. This method currently will not install cydia, unless your choice of Debian file is the Cydia Debian file. You can get the Cydia files at:
